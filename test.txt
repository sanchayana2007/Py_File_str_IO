Hello,
        You all know that the stay will be close to the peak,mid-way trekking.To rest comfortably for the night,it is advisable to carry "tents".
 
  Options:Hiring/Buying:
Renting or buying a tent is at the discretion of the individual participating in the trek.
 
However,i suggest you to make group of 2-3 and share the cost of buying a tent.Because renting a tent is as expensive as buying one.It may cost 500-600INR per individual on sharing basis.Also,you can use this or rent this to someone in future too. 
 
  People who wish to sleep in the open with a mat can do so but it is not advisable as it will be really cold out there.you will S H I V E R.
 
People buying sleeping bags will be under the risk of attacks by Mosquitoes/Leeches and a few unknown worms/creatures :) :) :)
 
  Some of them have visited "decathlon" store and they have found one model costing about 1800INR.
 
 So,dont wait.Decide,form a group and buy suitable ones for your comfortable shelter.
